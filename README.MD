# abCMS
This has been my ongoing project throughout siege. This week I have startred rewriting the entire thing in moonscript (lua) with the lapis framework.

I have done this mostly to create a better architecture to work in, and make even more of the site serverside. The current state is abysmal, so I don't expect to be voted on favorably.

The posting system works, and the feed is officially a grid to match the theme of week 10.
