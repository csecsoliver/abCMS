# abCMS
The abc management system. It will be an all in one system specifcally made to manage my homelab and related services.  
Right now it is however a bit off the tracks, it has become a blog platform encouraging frequent, but short posts, rewarding them with coins!!  
# My experience  
This is my first time working with htmx, but not my first time in the bottle.js ecosystem. I am not proficient in either of them right now, but I am getting used to their quirks.  
The htmx was seems the most like the php philosophy, which is not exactly what bottle is made for. I have only used very basic templates, using the python builtin .format() method, but the template() function in bottle seems intriguing.  
This is also my very first time using jwt authentication, and I already like it a lot more than I did my previous attepmts at token management.  
I also came to hate browser caching altogether, which is unreasonable, but it cost me like an hour of on-off debugging to figure out why the server did not log my request, despite the content appearing on the site.
